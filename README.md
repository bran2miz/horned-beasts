### Reflections

1. What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
  First and foremost, the main thing that went well today was being able to get my app to render on the browser. This was an extremely hard day, mainly due to the SSH key that was being a nuisance.
2. What did I learn today?
  SSH keys. Although the error of the SSH key was fairly easy to fix, it was actually going through the entire process of figuring out what the issue was.
3. What should I do differently next time?
  I don't believe I would've done anything differently! I asked for assistance when I needed it, and certainly learned a lot about SSH keys!
4. What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?
  I still have a few issues with understanding the terminal and why the npm start is so specific with error correction (spaces, etc).
5. Is the assignment complete? If not, where exactly did you leave off, and what work remains?
  I was pleasantly suprised that I was able to get it finished today! Although it may not look that great, with a little CSS via bootstrap, I think I will be able to create a beautiful React app!
